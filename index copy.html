    <h3>HTML 3</h3>
    <h4>January 14,1997</h4>
    <p>
      HTML 3.2 <sup>[15]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
      version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had
      closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. <sup>[16]</sup> Initially
      code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
      reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most
      of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's
      marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two
      companies. <sup>[13]</sup> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML
      was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
